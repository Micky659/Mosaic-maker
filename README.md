# Mosaic-maker

This program can generate an image that when seen from a distance look like a different picture but from up close it's actually made up of a small photo arranged in a grid.


## Input
The program takes two input images, first a block image that is used as an element in the matrix and the second a big image that is implemented over the matrix.
It's recommended that input images should be small in size as it will be easier to build the mosaic in a correct proportion.

## Output
Output of this program will be a matrix of block images and the final mosaic.
